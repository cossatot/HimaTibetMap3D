HimaTibetMap3D
==============

This is a preliminary/experimental implementation of a 3D version of HimaTibetMap.  Right now it is just 3D points / fault patches created through rule-based operations (algorithms)on fault traces, and has very little actual observational constraints on 3D geometry.  It is supposed to be suitable for some statistical analysis but probably not for anything fault-specific, such as rupture simulation or dislocation modeling.  

Although that would be awesome...

Metadata will also be included in some form, be it a separate dataframe or (eventually) ArcScene files and the like.


HimaTibetMap
-----------------
HimaTibetMap is an open-source database of active faults and associated features (suture zones, Cenozoic volcanic rocks) in the Indo-Asian collision zone.  It was created by Mike Taylor, An Yin, Richard Styron and Kelechi Okoronkwo, and is currently maintained by Styron.

Data Sources
--------------
This project draws heavily on published work, although a good portion of it is our own interpretation of field observations, remote sensing imagery, seismicity, etc.  The file 'references.txt' lists the papers we used.
